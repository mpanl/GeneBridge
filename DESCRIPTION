Description: GeneBridge is an R package designed to assess the evolutionary history of genes across diverse species. It implements the Bridge algorithm to infer the evolutionary root of genes in a given species tree. By rooting orthologous genes in large-scale evolutionary snalysis, GeneBridge can provide a framework for exploring evolutionary roots within biological systems.
